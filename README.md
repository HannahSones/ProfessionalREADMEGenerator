## About the project
This application generates a professional ReadME using only the command-line to prompt users for their answers. It requires users to enter a project title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. In addition, it also asks the user to select a license from a list adn this will generate a relevant badge that appears in the description of the ReadME. Lastly, it prompts the user to provide an email address and GitHub username which links to their profile.

To improve the appearance of the ReadME and create a better user experience, I have enabled them to select the colour of the license badge used. I have also set the title, email and GitHub username properties to be required and can't progress without them.
